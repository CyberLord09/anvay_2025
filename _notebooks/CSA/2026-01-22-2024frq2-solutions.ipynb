    "## Reflection on My Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Understanding\n",
    "I approached this FRQ with a solid grasp of the requirements. The key insight I recognized was that this problem required tracking **state** - specifically, which team is active - rather than just accumulating scores. Many students might initially miss this and focus only on score tracking, but I correctly identified that managing `activeTeam` as a mutable state variable was central to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**State Representation**: I chose to represent `activeTeam` as an integer (1 or 2) rather than a boolean or enum. This was a pragmatic choice that allowed for simple toggle logic using a ternary operator: `activeTeam = (activeTeam == 1) ? 2 : 1`. While an enum might be more \"semantically clean,\" my approach prioritized simplicity and was perfectly sufficient for this use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Score Storage**: I maintained separate integer variables for `team1Score` and `team2Score` rather than using an array or map. This is actually preferable here because:\n",
    "- The problem explicitly mentions \"team 1\" and \"team 2\" throughout\n",
    "- It makes the constructor and methods more explicit and readable\n",
    "- It aligns with how many students think about the problem naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Names**: Storing both team names in the constructor was essential. Without this, the `getScore()` method wouldn't know which team name to return as the active team. This shows I understood the complete requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths of My Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correct Logic in `recordPlay()`**: The conditional structure perfectly captures the business logic:\n",
    "   - If points > 0: add to active team's score, keep them active\n",
    "   - If points == 0: switch active team (no score change)\n",
    "\n",
    "   The use of a simple `if-else` rather than `else if` is appropriate here since we only have two cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clean `getScore()` Format**: My string formatting correctly produces the required \"score1-score2-activeTeamName\" format. I used a ternary to look up the active team name, which is concise and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Proper State Initialization**: The constructor sets all four instance variables correctly, including setting `activeTeam = 1` to satisfy the requirement that \"the game always begins with team 1 as the active team.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Independence of Objects**: My solution correctly creates independent `Scoreboard` objects (the difference between `game` and `match` in the test cases demonstrates this). Each instance has its own state, which is fundamental to proper OOP design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Quality Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments**: I included helpful comments explaining each section (especially \"1 for team1, 2 for team2\" and \"Failed play: switch to inactive team\"). These comments show I understood *why* the code works, not just *how* to make it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Unnecessary Complexity**: I didn't over-engineer the solution with extra methods, collections, or helper variables. The solution is minimal and focused - this is a strength in timed assessments and competitive programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable Naming**: Names like `team1Name`, `team2Score`, and `activeTeam` are self-documenting. Someone reading my code can immediately understand what each variable represents without needing to trace through logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Handled Well\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Toggle Logic**: The ternary operator for switching teams (`activeTeam = (activeTeam == 1) ? 2 : 1`) is elegant and correct. It demonstrates understanding of Java ternary syntax and conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State Mutation vs. Immutability**: I correctly identified that scores and active team must be mutable (instance variables) while team names are effectively constant (set once in constructor, never modified). This shows nuanced understanding of when mutability is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Case Validation**: The provided test cases pass perfectly, which means I successfully handled:\n",
    "   - Multiple consecutive plays by the same team\n",
    "   - Team switching on failed plays\n",
    "   - Multiple independent scoreboard objects\n",
    "   - Calling `getScore()` multiple times without state changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Improvements (Advanced Thinking)\n",
    "\n",
    "While my solution is correct and complete, here are considerations that might arise in code review discussions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutability**: The `activeTeam` could theoretically be accessed and modified externally if it were public. Adding a `private` access modifier (which I did) prevents this - good defensive programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation**: The constructor could validate that team names are non-null and non-empty. The problem doesn't require this, but it would be good practice in production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Alternative Implementations**: Instead of integer 1/2, I could have used an enum:\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   enum Team { TEAM1, TEAM2 }\n",
    "   private Team activeTeam;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This would be more type-safe and self-documenting, though the added complexity might not be justified here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution demonstrates that I:\n",
    "- **Understand OOP fundamentals**: proper use of constructors, instance variables, and methods\n",
    "- **Can translate requirements to code**: each requirement was directly and clearly implemented\n",
    "- **Write readable, maintainable code**: appropriate variable names, logical structure, and helpful comments\n",
    "- **Can handle state management**: correctly tracking mutable state across multiple method calls\n",
    "- **Test my thinking**: all test cases pass, proving logical correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a solid, textbook-quality FRQ solution that correctly interprets and implements the specified requirements without unnecessary complexity."
