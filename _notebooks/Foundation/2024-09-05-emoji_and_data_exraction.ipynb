       "\n",
       "The teams had multiple challenges to defend computer systems from attacks by cyber security professionals playing the role of hackers. There were three components ‚Äî the Windows and Linux operating systems and a Cisco networking software system.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely proud of my teams winning both the CyberPatriot Middle School Division and Open Division, for the fourth year in a row,‚Äù said coach Paul Johnson. ‚ÄúEight new national champion teams in four years. During the extremely difficult and intense season-long competition, the teams displayed exceptional teamwork, leadership, grit, determination and passion.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "The middle school streak in the Air Force Association‚Äôs national youth cyber education program began in the 2017-18 season when an Oak Valley team won. The school also won the title in 2018-19 and 2020-21. This year a team from Design39Campus won the title ‚Äî it also had the champion-winning teams in 2019-20 and 2021-22.\n",
       "\n",
       "Johnson‚Äôs students this year came out as champions over the 5,584 teams that entered regional events across the country. The top 28 teams at the high school and middle school levels competing in the finals defended networks, services and mobile devices from attacks by hackers.\n",

       "Last month‚Äôs CyberPatriot XV National Finals were held in Bethesda, Maryland.\n",

       "‚ÄúThe students are always very hard working and sharp, always passionate,‚Äù Johnson said.\n",

       "At this point, Johnson said the pressure on the teams is to continue their winning-streak tradition.\n",
       "\n",
       "Four Del Norte High students ‚Äî Akhil Guntur, Jonathan Lin, Akshay Rohatgi and Alvin Zheng ‚Äî were named Cyber All-American Award Recipients because they qualified for the National Finals all four years of their high school competition seasons.\n",

       "\n",
       "This was the third time Arora was on a national team. The 17-year-old junior made it as a seventh- and eighth-grader, and his team won the national title when he was in eighth grade.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to being his team‚Äôs captain this year, Arora was also the program‚Äôs president.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good experience,‚Äù Arora said. ‚ÄúI worked more directly with Coach Paul and as president of the club ‚Ä¶ I built my leadership skills by working with older and younger students. The seniors could be more difficult to lead, and it was a bit of a challenge to lead students my age. They are my peers and I had to give them instructions ‚Ä¶ I learned how to balance personalities.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "Communication is the key to good teamwork, he said. While considering a career in data science or computer science, Arora said the leadership lessons he has learned will carry over in whatever career he ultimately chooses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Going to Maryland for nationals was a ‚Äúfun experience‚Äù because he could bond with his teammates away from home, he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Arora said he also enjoyed the program‚Äôs outreach events with elementary and low-income students throughout the year. Team members provided classes and workshops to introduce cybersecurity concepts and skills to students who otherwise would not be exposed to the field.\n",
       "\n",
       "The CyberAegis Vitalis from Design39Campus won the national champion in the Middle School Division. They were team captain Yash Parikh, Neil Chandra, Risha Guha, Ansh Kumar, Krish Nandola and Anvay Vahia.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúI really love competing in this program. We do our best ‚Ä¶ and whatever happens give it our all,‚Äù said Guha, one of three girls on PUSD‚Äôs national teams.\n",
       "\n",
       "The 14-year-old eighth-grader said more girls are getting interested in cybersecurity and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math), something she is trying to encourage. She was among the students who helped with training their peers in the CyberPatriot program and she organized outreach events, such as a workshop for 150 fifth-graders and for 30 Junior Girl Scouts in fourth and fifth grade.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was Guha‚Äôs third time competing at nationals and second time winning the championship. She said the previous trips helped her team know what to expect in the competition.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúI enjoy the fact that we‚Äôre digging deep into computer infrastructure to find everyday problems and how to solve them,‚Äù Guha said, adding that the challenges are ‚Äúreally fun.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "The national runner-up was CyberAegis Aeris from Oak Valley Middle School, which also won the Cisco Networking Challenge. Its members were team captain Mihir Bapat, Aditya Katre, Kanhay Patil, Dhyan Soni, Xavier Thompson and Jacob Wu.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs intimidating, being 40 to 50 feet from the hackers,‚Äù said Bapat, 13. ‚ÄúThey are trying to get into your system to cause problems.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "While the students could not see the cybersecurity experts playing the role of hackers in the competition, Bapat said the event is ‚Äúexcruciating, but fun ‚Ä¶ it creates a lot of pressure.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "Bapat added, ‚ÄúDuring the entire competition you have to keep your cool because you do not want to panic or be frantic in any way because the hackers will take advantage of that.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "As team captain, Bapat, an eighth-grader, said his responsibilities included keeping his five other teammates motivated.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúIf anyone needs something I have to be there for them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo one is perfect, this is a team effort.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "His team won the Cisco Networking Challenge, a component of the competition. He said it consisted of two parts and his responsibility was working on the Windows operating system.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúI enjoy securing the system that I use daily,‚Äù Bapat said.\n",
       "\n",
       "He explained that there are many ways a hacker can get into the system and there are simple ways people can fix weaknesses in their software, but they need to know where to look.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúFinding fixes is intriguing, I am finding the insecurities that are hiding in our systems,‚Äù Bapat said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Johnson built the program for Del Norte, Oak Valley and Design39Campus over the past nine years, comparing it to the farm system in baseball. There is a training period during the spring ‚Äî it has already begun for the 2023-24 season ‚Äî where all middle and high school students at these campuses are offered an opportunity to learn about cyber security.\n",
       "\n",
       "By the end of the school year, they will be tested and the top 120 students will continue training over the summer. He has the high school students and some eighth-graders take on mentorship roles, where they teach their peers the skills they need.\n",
       "\n",
       "Johnson volunteers his time to coach the teams. He retired as a senior staff cyber systems engineer at Northrop Grumman, but now works part-time as a consultant for the company. He considered retiring as the CyberPatriot coach, but decided to continue for now.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúAs long as they are performing at this level, as long as the students will have this winning drive (I‚Äôll continue),‚Äù Johnson said."

It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\n",
