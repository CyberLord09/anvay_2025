    "# MCQ Corrections and Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this MCQ went well for me. I got a 65/66 in 01:39:36. I feel that this was a good accomplishment because I spent an ample amount of time on each problem and spent my time well. This question was based on the topic of algorithms and conditionals and is shown below. In the quiz, I learned a lot about different ways to write algorithms and much more such as encryption.\n",

    "## Why I Got This Question Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, I had to complete the `<MISSING CODE>` section of a robot's program to ensure it successfully moved to the **gray square** in the grid. First, heres what I understood in the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Details:\n",
    "1. **Robot Behavior**:\n",
    "   - The robot starts in the bottom-left corner of the grid, initially facing up.\n",
    "   - It can move into **white** or **gray** squares but must avoid all other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Objective**:\n",
    "   - The robot needs to move to the gray square\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Structure**:\n",
    "   - The code uses the `GoalReached()` procedure, which returns `true` when the robot is in the gray square.\n",
    "   - A loop (`REPEAT UNTIL (GoalReached())`) makes sure the robot continues trying until it reaches the gray square.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Answer (C): Why It Was Incorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected the following code for `<MISSING CODE>`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`IF (CAN_MOVE (forward))`\n",
    "`{`\n",
    "`    MOVE_FORWARD ()`\n",
    "`}`\n",
    "`ROTATE_RIGHT ()`\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "1. The robot first checks if it can move forward. If yes, it moves forward.\n",
    "2. Regardless of whether it moves forward or not, the robot then rotates right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Failed:\n",
    "- Unnecessary Rotations:\n",
    "   - The robot rotates right even when it doesn’t need to.\n",
    "- Inefficient Navigation:\n",
    "   - The logic doesn’t properly change the robot’s direction based on its surroundings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correct Answer: A\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`IF (CAN_MOVE (right))`\n",
    "`{`\n",
    "`    ROTATE_RIGHT ()`\n",
    "`}`\n",
    "`MOVE_FORWARD ()`\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "1. The robot checks if it can move to the right. If yes, it rotates to face the right direction.\n",
    "2. Once it’s facing the correct direction, it moves forward.\n",

    "# My Biggest Accomplishment for Sprint 3: Creating a Voting API\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my highlights during sprint 3 was designing and implementing a working API for managing votes on our chatroom's posts. This API handles **upvotes**, **downvotes**, and helps the backend retrieve detailed voting data for posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of the API \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vote Creation and Updating**:\n",
    "   - Users can upvote or downvote a specific post.\n",
    "   - If a vote already exists for the user and post, the vote type is updated instead of creating a duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vote Deletion**:\n",
    "   - Users can remove their vote from a post.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieving Data**:\n",
    "   - The API provides stuff including (also depicted in the picture below):\n",
    "     - The number of upvotes and downvotes.\n",
    "     - Details of each individual upvote or downvote.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/voteapi.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the main logic of my API:\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Endpoints\n",
    "1. **POST /vote**:\n",
    "   - Creates or updates a vote for a specific post.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```json\n",
    "     {\n",
    "         \"post_id\": 1,\n",
    "         \"vote_type\": \"upvote\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DELETE /vote**:\n",
    "   - Removes a user’s vote from a post.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GET /vote/post**:\n",
    "   - Retrieves all votes for a post\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Overall, creating this API helped me greatly with my understanding of backend structure and APIs in general."
