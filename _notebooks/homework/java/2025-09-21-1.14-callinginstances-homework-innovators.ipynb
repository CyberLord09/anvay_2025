    "## MC Question Answers with Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Answer - B\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: B**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "BankAccount account = new BankAccount(100.0);\n",
    "account.deposit(50.0);\n",
    "double total = account.getBalance();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Explanations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A) INCORRECT** - `BankAccount.deposit(50.0);` and `BankAccount.getBalance();` attempt to call instance methods as if they were static methods. Instance methods must be called on an object instance, not on the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **B) CORRECT** - This properly creates a BankAccount object, then calls instance methods on that specific object. The sequence is: create object → call deposit method → call getBalance method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **C) INCORRECT** - `double total = account.deposit(50.0);` tries to assign the return value of `deposit()` to a double variable, but `deposit()` is a void method that doesn't return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **D) INCORRECT** - `BankAccount account;` declares a reference variable but doesn't initialize it to an object. Calling methods on an uninitialized reference will cause a NullPointerException.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **E) INCORRECT** - `getBalance()` is called without an object reference. Instance methods must be called on a specific object instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Answer - C (48)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: C - 48**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step execution:**\n",
    "1. `Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(3, 4);` - Creates rectangle with length=3, width=4\n",
    "2. `rect.scale(2);` - Multiplies both dimensions by 2: length=6, width=8\n",
    "3. `rect.getArea()` - Calculates area: 6 × 8 = 48\n",
    "4. `System.out.println(48);` - Prints 48\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why other answers are wrong:**\n",
    "- **A) 12** - This would be the original area (3×4) before scaling\n",
    "- **B) 24** - This would be if only one dimension was scaled\n",
    "- **D) 96** - This would be if the area was calculated then scaled (12×2×4)\n",
    "- **E)** - The code compiles and runs perfectly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Answer - B\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: B - When the method is called on a reference variable that has not been initialized to an object**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Explanation:**\n",
    "A `NullPointerException` occurs when you try to call a method on a null reference. This happens when:\n",
    "- You declare a reference variable but never assign it to an object\n",
    "- You explicitly set a reference to null\n",
    "- A method returns null and you call a method on that return value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example that causes NullPointerException:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "BankAccount account;  // declared but not initialized (null by default)\n",
    "account.deposit(50);  // NullPointerException here!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why other answers are wrong:**\n",
    "- **A)** - `void` methods can be called normally; return type doesn't affect this\n",
    "- **C)** - Parameter mismatches cause compile-time errors, not NullPointerException\n",
    "- **D)** - Methods can be called from outside the class if they're public\n",
    "- **E)** - Returning a value from void method causes compile error, not runtime exception\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Answer - D\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: D**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Temperature temp = new Temperature(15);\n",
    "int result = temp.setCelsius(30);  // ERROR: void method cannot be assigned to variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Explanation:**\n",
    "The `setCelsius` method is declared as `void`, meaning it doesn't return a value. Attempting to assign its \"return value\" to an `int` variable causes a compile-time error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis of each option:**\n",
    "- **A) CORRECT** - Creates object and calls getFahrenheit() which returns a double\n",
    "- **B) CORRECT** - Creates object and calls setCelsius() without trying to capture return value\n",
    "- **C) CORRECT** - Creates object, calls getFahrenheit(), and assigns return value to double variable\n",
    "- **D) INCORRECT** - Tries to assign void method's \"return value\" to int variable\n",
    "- **E) CORRECT** - Valid sequence of method calls with proper variable assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Answer - D\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: D - `System.out.println(novel.getPages());`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** After the code executes:\n",
    "- `Book novel = new Book(\"Java Basics\", 200);` - Creates book with 200 pages\n",
    "- `novel.addPages(50);` - Adds 50 pages, making total 250 pages\n",
    "- Need to print the current number of pages (250)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Analysis:**\n",
    "- **A) INCORRECT** - `pages` is not accessible; it's a local variable name, not the instance variable\n",
    "- **B) INCORRECT** - `novel.pages` attempts direct access to private instance variable, which causes compile error\n",
    "- **C) INCORRECT** - `Book.getPages()` treats getPages as static method, but it's an instance method\n",
    "- **D) CORRECT** - `novel.getPages()` properly calls the instance method on the novel object, returning current page count (250)\n",
    "- **E) INCORRECT** - `getPages()` called without object reference; instance methods need an object\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept:** Private instance variables can only be accessed through public methods (getters/setters), and instance methods must be called on specific object instances."

    "| Criteria | Percent Weight | Description |\n",
    "|----------|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Functionality** | 40% | Program runs without errors, creates multiple Student objects, correctly adds grades, calculates averages, and assigns letter grades |\n",
    "| **Method Implementation** | 30% | Includes all required methods (addGrade, getAverage, getLetterGrade, printReport) that properly access/modify instance variables |\n",
    "| **Code Quality** | 20% | Clean code with meaningful variable names, proper constructor, and helpful comments explaining method purposes |\n",
    "| **Output & Presentation** | 10% | Clear, well-formatted output showing multiple students with different grades and formatted reports |\n",

    "## Tips for Getting Started\n",
    "- Review the Counter example from the lesson notes—your Student class will work similarly\n",
    "- Start by creating the Student class with the three instance variables\n",
    "- Write your constructor to initialize the name and set totalPoints and numAssignments to 0\n",
    "- Implement `addGrade()` first—it should add to totalPoints and increment numAssignments\n",
    "- Test each method before moving to the next one\n",
    "- Remember: Test your hack multiple times and add updates in small increments in case you run into an error\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "1. **Start simple** - Get your constructor and `addGrade()` working first before tackling calculations\n",
    "2. **Watch for division** - When calculating average, make sure to cast to double: `(double)totalPoints / numAssignments`\n",
    "3. **Test with multiple students** - Create at least 2 Student objects with different grades to show independence\n",
    "4. **Comment your code** - Explain what each method does, especially your letter grade logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Challenges (Optional for Extra Credit)\n",
    "Want to go above and beyond? Try adding:\n",
    "- A `getHighestGrade()` method that tracks and returns the best individual grade (you'll need to store individual grades, not just the total)\n",
    "- A `getLowestGrade()` method for the lowest individual grade\n",
    "- A `dropLowestGrade()` method that removes the lowest grade from calculations\n",
    "- A `compareTo(Student other)` method that compares two students' averages\n",
    "- Weighted grades—allow some assignments to be worth more points than others\n",
    "- A `reset()` method that clears all grades and starts fresh\n",
    "- Error checking to prevent negative grades or invalid input\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good luck!**\n",

    "| **Method Implementation** | 30% | 30/30 | ✅ Includes ALL required methods: `addGrade()` (void - modifies totals), `getAverage()` (returns double), `getLetterGrade()` (returns String), `printReport()` (void - displays formatted output). All methods properly access/modify instance variables |\n",
    "| **Code Quality** | 20% | 20/20 | ✅ Clean code with meaningful variable names (`totalPoints`, `numAssignments`), proper constructor initialization, comprehensive comments explaining each method's purpose, and proper formatting |\n",
