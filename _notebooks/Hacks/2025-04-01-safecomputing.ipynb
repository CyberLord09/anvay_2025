    "Explanations of SSID Cookie\n",
    "- A cookie is a piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit it. Cookies help websites remember information about the user, like login status, language preferences, or items in a shopping cart. They are essential for personalizing  web experience and for enabling features like staying logged in between sessions.\n",
    "- The SSID cookie, specifically, is used by websites like Google to identify and authenticate users. It helps verify that you're signed in to your Google account and ensures you're getting personalized content (like your YouTube homepage or Google search results). The SSID cookie may store encrypted information like your Google account ID and the time you signed in. While it doesn’t contain your password, it’s an important part of how Google keeps you logged in securely.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **What does Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) require?**  \n",
    "   -  **Multiple forms of identity verification before granting access**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** MFA improves security by requiring two or more types of credentials (like a password *and* a code sent to your phone).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which encryption type is best suited for secure online communication where users do not need to share a common key?**  \n",
    "   - **Asymmetric Encryption**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Asymmetric encryption uses a public and private key pair. You can encrypt with someone’s public key and only their private key can decrypt it—no shared secret needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What does PII stand for?**  \n",
    "   - **Personally Identifiable Information**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** PII includes information like your name, address, SSN, or anything that can be used to identify you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Which of the following is an example of ethical computing?**  \n",
    "   - **Respecting privacy policies and obtaining user consent before collecting data**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Ethical computing involves being respectful, transparent, and responsible with technology and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Which encryption type uses the same key for both encryption and decryption?**  \n",
    "   - **Symmetric Encryption**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** In symmetric encryption, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Both users need access to that same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **A user receives an email from their bank asking them to confirm their account details by clicking on a link. What is the best course of action?**  \n",
    "   - **Verify the legitimacy of the email by contacting the bank directly through official contact methods**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** This could be a phishing scam. Never click suspicious links—always verify through official channels.\n",

    "---\n",

    "7. **Which of the following best describes phishing?**  \n",
    "   - **A scam where an attacker tricks users into providing personal information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Phishing is about pretending—like fake emails or websites—to trick people into giving up sensitive info.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **A student downloads a free version of a popular software from an unknown website. What is the primary risk in this situation?**  \n",
    "   - **The software could contain malware or viruses that compromise the computer’s security**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Unverified downloads often hide malware. It’s always best to use official or trusted sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Why is public key encryption considered more secure for transmitting sensitive data over the internet?**  \n",
    "   - **Even if the public key is known, only the private key can decrypt the message.**  \n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Public key encryption ensures confidentiality because even if someone has the public key, they can't decrypt messages without the private key.\n",
