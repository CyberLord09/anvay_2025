    "Implicit data is information collected from a user’s behavior and actions without them directly providing it. This happens in the background as the user interacts with a system. For example, a streaming app might track which shows a user watches the most or how long they watch certain genres. Additionally, a social media app may also collect data on what types of videos users like to suggest them with other videos similar to those. Other examples include search history, location data, or which links a user clicks on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit data is information the user gives directly and on purpose. This includes things like filling out a form, choosing interests when signing up, or rating a product. For example, if a user selects “action movies” as their favorite genre or writes a review that’s explicit data. Other examples include selecting a preferred language during setting up an account or choosing favorite topics or categories in a news app."
