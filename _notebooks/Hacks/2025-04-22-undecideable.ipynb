    "1. True or False. An algorithm can be used to solve an undecideable problem. \n",
    " - False. An algorithm cannot be used to solve an undecidable problem because, by definition, there is no algorithm that can provide a correct yes-or-no output for all possible inputs. Undecidable problems do not have a universal procedure that works for every case, so any algorithm will fail to correctly solve the problem for some inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If a programmer encounters an undecideable problem,they can just use an algorithm that works most of the time. \n",
    " - False. While a programmer might attempt to create an algorithm that works for many inputs, the problem remains undecidable because there will always be some inputs for which the algorithm cannot give a guaranteed correct answer. According to the College Board, a problem is only decidable if there exists an algorithm that works correctly for all inputs. An algorithm that works most of the time does not make an undecidable problem decidable.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. How did changing the order of coins affect the result?\n",
    "Changing the coin order from largest-to-smallest to smallest-to-largest made the algorithm much less efficient. Instead of picking the biggest coin available, the algorithm kept adding small coins, which increased the total number used and slowed down the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which algorithm used fewer coins?\n",
    "The original greedy algorithm with coins in descending order used fewer coins. This is because it prioritized the highest possible value at each step, which reduced the number of total coins needed to reach the amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Where might greedy algorithms work well? Where might they fail?\n",
    "Greedy algorithms work well when the problem’s structure allows local decisions to lead to a global best outcome—like U.S. coin denominations. However, they can fail when a short-term choice prevents the best overall result, such as in certain custom coin systems or in complex pathfinding problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is one thing you changed, and what did it show you?\n",
    "I changed the order of the coin values from [25, 10, 5, 1] to [1, 5, 10, 25] to reverse the greedy strategy. This showed that the same algorithm can behave completely differently based on input setup, and that heuristics aren’t guaranteed to be efficient without the right conditions.\n"
