## Comparing Myself to the Beginning of the Year

When I think back to the start of the year, my understanding of computer science felt much more linear and mechanical. I could write programs, debug code, and follow instructions, but I hadn’t yet developed a sense of **how systems connect**, or how to manage large-scale, multi-component projects.  

The **Quest of Code** project completely shifted that mindset. Through coordinating teams, writing modular code, and integrating APIs, I’ve learned that software development is not about isolated syntax—it’s about **orchestration, communication, and structure**.  

At the start of the year:
- I focused mainly on solving problems independently.
- My version control experience was limited to personal repositories.
- I viewed projects as a collection of separate assignments rather than a unified product.

Now, I see projects as living systems. I understand how **front-end design connects to backend logic**, how **data is stored and visualized**, and how **collaboration drives innovation**. More importantly, I’ve learned to balance **technical depth** with **clarity and documentation**—a skill that has reshaped how I write and present code.

## What I Want to Do Next on the Project

If given more time on the Quest of Code project, my next goals would be focused on **expanding interactivity** and **data integration** within the portfolio ecosystem.  

### Planned Next Steps:
1. **Integrate the Code Runner into More Items on Pages**  
   Connect the compiler tool to other lessons so students can run Java or Python examples directly within their lessons.

2. **Add Account-Based Progress Tracking**  
   Enable personalized dashboards where students can log in and view their learning statistics, modules completed, and badges earned.

These additions would move the portfolio from being a static showcase into a **dynamic learning environment**—something that grows and responds to user activity.

## What I Want to Learn Next in Computer Science

This project made me realize that I enjoy working at the **intersection of software architecture and development tools**.  
I want to deepen my understanding of:

- **Backend scalability** – learning how to optimize APIs and manage databases across distributed systems.  
- **DevOps workflows** – using tools like Docker, CI/CD, and cloud deployment pipelines.  
- **Data analytics and AI integration** – automating insights from user interaction data.  
- **Secure web development** – learning to protect APIs, prevent vulnerabilities, and harden authentication flows.

In short, I want to move beyond building features toward understanding how to **design full ecosystems**—secure, measurable, and scalable.

## Analytics Review: Tracking My Contributions and Impact

While collaboration was central to the Quest, I also made significant individual contributions across the repository. Using GitHub’s built-in analytics tools, I analyzed my commit history, page activity, and performance data to measure my growth.

### Commit Graph – Development Activity

My commit frequency shows consistent contributions over time, particularly during development and integration phases of the project.  
The peaks align with **integration**, and **testing cycles** for the Code Runner and orchestration.

These commits reflect not just code changes but documentation updates, bug fixes, and backend deployment iterations—especially for the `/run/python`, `/run/java`, and `/run/javascript` API routes.

### Pages Analytics – Portfolio Engagement

The OpenCS Pages analytics data and shows that I have been commiting and participating frequently.

These analytics demonstrate that my work was consistent and plentiful.

### Grade Predictor Dashboard – Performance Insights

To evaluate my learning quantitatively, I tracked progress using the **grade predictor analytics dashboard**, which showed me my grade based on participating.

By maintaining consistent engagement and completing every phase of the project—from ideation to integration—I strengthened both my technical skills and my sense of accountability.

## Reflection Summary

This trimester marked a significant transformation in how I approach computer science.  
I’ve evolved from thinking like a coder to thinking like a **developer and designer**—someone who can architect systems, manage teams, and document ideas clearly.

The analytics show measurable growth, but the real value lies in what can’t be quantified: learning to adapt, collaborate, and think critically.  
As I move forward, I aim to continue building tools that connect learning with creativity and turn abstract ideas into interactive, real-world experiences.
