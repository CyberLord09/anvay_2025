# Night at the Museum Reflection

## Overview

Our N@tM  was an opportunity for us to share the projects we’ve developed throughout the trimester with parents, teachers, and other visitors. Our team presented our **Computer Science Portfolio project**, which focused on helping students build modules to **showcase their learning, demonstrate proficiency, and reflect on growth** in computer science. The goal of our work was to make technical learning visible—allowing students to not just complete coding assignments but to communicate their process, creativity, and understanding.

## Presenting to Parents and Guests

During the event, we discussed how our portfolio site allows students to organize their projects into structured modules. These modules highlight learning objectives, evidence of mastery, and reflections that make each project meaningful. Parents were very interested in how this format connected technical skills to real-world communication and presentation abilities.  

Many of them asked questions about how we designed the modules and how they could help students in other classes. Their curiosity showed how important it is to make learning in computer science understandable beyond the classroom. Several visitors mentioned that they were impressed by how confidently we explained both the technical and reflective parts of our work.

## Feedback and Interaction

After our presentation, I also visited other teams’ displays and gave feedback on their projects. This was a great experience because it allowed me to see how different groups approached creativity, data visualization, and problem-solving in computer science. Providing feedback helped me think more critically about how we present our own work and what makes a project engaging for an outside audience.

## Reflection

N@tM was a meaningful experience because it gave us the chance to see our work from a new perspective—through the eyes of parents and teachers. Their reactions and questions helped me realize how important communication and presentation are in computer science, not just coding itself. It was rewarding to see people genuinely interested in what we built and to know that our work made an impact beyond the classroom.
