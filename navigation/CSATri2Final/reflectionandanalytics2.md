## Comparing Myself to the Beginning of the Trimester

At the beginning of this trimester, I approached projects mainly from a feature-based mindset. My goal was usually to make something work as quickly as possible. If the code ran and the UI looked fine, I considered it complete. However, I did not always think deeply about structure, long-term organization, or how different systems connected together.

Over the course of this trimester, that changed.

Instead of just adding features, I focused on refining systems. I worked extensively on restructuring dashboards, separating analytics from preferences, debugging backend communication issues, and improving the flow between frontend and backend services. I learned that writing working code is only the first step — maintaining clarity and organization is what makes a project scalable.

Earlier in the year:
- I focused mostly on individual features.
- I debugged reactively rather than methodically.
- I didn’t always separate responsibilities clearly in my code.

Now:
- I think about structure before implementing.
- I debug by tracing the full data flow.
- I separate frontend logic, backend routes, and state management more intentionally.

This shift made my work cleaner and more sustainable.

## What I Worked On This Trimester

This trimester involved continuous refinement and expansion of the portfolio ecosystem. I worked on improving dashboard functionality, analytics systems, backend communication, and UI structure.

A large portion of my time was spent debugging asynchronous fetch requests, handling secure API routes, and ensuring data loaded correctly under different tab conditions. There were moments where analytics would not render or backend routes would not respond as expected, and I had to carefully trace JSON payloads, HTTP methods, and authentication logic.

I also improved the structure of the dashboard by separating major responsibilities into cleaner sections. Instead of mixing preferences, analytics, and evaluation tools into one large file, I reorganized components into more modular sections. This made the system easier to manage and expand.

Throughout this process, I became more confident in:

- Managing API communication across services  
- Handling asynchronous JavaScript properly  
- Debugging backend route conflicts  
- Structuring dashboards for clarity  
- Thinking about maintainability rather than short-term fixes  

The trimester was less about creating one single flashy feature and more about strengthening the foundation of the entire system.

## Challenges I Faced

One of the biggest challenges this trimester was debugging issues that were not obvious syntax errors. Many problems were related to data not loading, promises not resolving, incorrect HTTP methods, or authentication blocking requests.

These types of bugs required patience. I had to:

- Inspect network requests
- Check response payloads
- Compare expected vs actual data
- Rework fetch timing logic
- Reorganize tab event listeners

Earlier in the year, I would often rewrite large sections when something broke. This trimester, I focused on isolating the root cause instead. That change alone shows growth in how I approach problem-solving.

## What I Improved

The biggest improvement this trimester was in system thinking.

I now:

- Design before coding.
- Separate concerns clearly.
- Think about user flow and backend flow simultaneously.
- Structure dashboards for long-term expansion.
- Debug logically instead of emotionally.

Instead of just completing assignments, I worked consistently to refine and strengthen the overall portfolio infrastructure.

## Reflection Summary

This trimester reflects steady growth rather than one dramatic change. My work became more structured, my debugging became more disciplined, and my understanding of frontend-backend interaction improved significantly.

I am no longer just writing code to make something work — I am building systems that are organized, expandable, and maintainable.

That shift in mindset is the most important growth I experienced this trimester.
