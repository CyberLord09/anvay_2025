## VSCode
1. I installed [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from the website that is linked
2. The installer asked for some additional information and I made sure to choose “Add to PATH”.
   - To my understanding, in Windows, the "PATH" is an environment variable that tells the system where to find executable files. When you add a directory to the PATH, you enable the system to locate and run programs from that directory without specifying the full path. This is especially useful for accessing command-line tools or applications conveniently from any location in the command prompt or PowerShell
3. Add "Remote Development extension pack" in VSCode
   - This allows me to edit in VSCode while also syncing remotely

## WSL
1. I went to Powershell as an admin and ran: <code>wsl --install</code>
2. I restarted my computer
3. I set up my WSL account with a username and password

## Github Integration with CLI
1. Make sure to set up my user ID and Github email
2. Install git to be able to push and pull from origin and upstream repositories. 

## Make
1. I made sure to install all prequisites and then activate the virual environment (venv).
2. Now I was able to make and make my own local build of the site.

## Theme
Once having the site up and running, I didnt really like the original theme. To have more of a say in the look of my website, I added a LOT of CSS.
